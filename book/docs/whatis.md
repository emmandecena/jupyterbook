## What is Loan Analysis?

Loan analysis is an evaluation method that determines if loans are made on feasible terms and if potential borrowers can and are willing to pay back the loan. It checks the eligibility of the potential borrower against the criteria set forth for lending.

Loan analysis gives the creditor a measure of safety on the loan by determining the probability that the borrower will pay back the loan (principal and interest). Follow-up visits to the potential borrower, especially for individual loans, help the lending institution gauge the performance of the investments or assets that are intended to generate revenues to help settle the loans.


### Quick Summary

- It checks the eligibility of the potential borrower against the criteria set forth for lending.
- Loan analysis helps in assessing the skills and financial knowledge of the borrower to determine the level of risk involved.


### Lending Guidelines

Lenders work under governmental financial regulatory bodies, which provide various regulatory guidelines to guide the operations of the institutions. Every institution, however, follows its own internal guidelines in line with the regulatory guidelines imposed by the government or its agencies. Loan guidelines include eligibility rules, type of loans to be provided, conditions on loans, loan security, and procedures.

Not everyone is eligible for a loan unless they meet the lending criteria provided by the specific lending institution. When conducting a loan analysis on a potential client, lending institutions analyze the financial statements of the client to determine their financial capability and their ability to honor the loan obligations without strain.
