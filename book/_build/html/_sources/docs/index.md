# Preface

Hello! I'm Emmanuel.

An energy market analyst with experience in trading operations of geothermal power plants and in electrical systems design of gas processing plants.

I provide solutions to product improvement and process optimization problems by setting up analytical tools, creating and maintaining models, and streamlining new data sets.

My career has made me wear many hats, such as in engineering, systems design, mathematical modelling, product marketing and research.

This makes me a data scientist with broad technical skills, and specific domain knowledge in the electric power industry.

By having a T-shaped professional profile, I provide data-driven solutions to business problems in energy and related industries.

I am seeking for **full-time data science or machine learning roles**. Please feel free to contact me through the information in my [**resume**](https://www.ecdecena.com/cv/resume-emmanuel-decena.pdf). If you have a **part-time project** I can help with, please get in touch.

I wrote this website to demonstrate my domain knowledge, technology tools, and lessons learned throughout my career. My goal is to document the systems I use and to serve as my personal reference.

**Specialties**: energy markets, electric power industry, mathematical optimization, statistics, data analysis, system modelling, business intelligence, and research

**Competencies**: R, Python, Excel, Matlab, Julia, SQL, Linux

## Workflow

This section illustrates my typical workflow in an analytics project. We refer to figure {numref}`workflow` {cite}`wickham2016r` which focuses on the tools and techniques in data science. We assume that we have completely defined our problem statement beforehand.

The first step, **Import**, falls under the domain of Data Engineering. Data in the real world does not come in tidy little csv files. Instead, it comes in messy, incomplete, and from various sources that sometimes require developing a separate infrastructure to import.

The next steps, **Transform**, **Visualize**, and **Model**, are the main processes and are iterative. We begin by transforming the data: selecting, mutating, filtering, interpolating, etc, to gain better insight into its structure.

We visualize the results, looking at different dimensions to uncover patterns and find correlations. We then develop models that attempt to emulate the system behavior and do tests to see if our hypothesis about the relationships between variables hold.

Domain knowledge and experience play a key role in choosing the modeling and visualization techniques suitable for the data.

Finally, through **Report** we provide the stakeholders with the results of the analysis for decision-making. To do this, we develop communication tools such as beautiful reports, online dashboards, and full-on applications that present the data with fresh insights.
